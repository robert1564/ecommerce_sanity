# About

In this e-commerce NextJs application you can made purchases of different products. Here you will have a shopping cart too, where you can review all the products that you added and you want to buy them. Also, every product on the page has a unique page where you can find more products images, a description of that specific product, a quantity toggle to choose how many products of the same type you want to buy and buttons to add to cart or buy the product right away. Here you will have a section of recommended products that you may also like.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
